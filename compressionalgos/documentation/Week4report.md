# Week 4

[Time report](https://github.com/aleksinuora/compressionalgos/blob/master/compressionalgos/documentation/Time%20report.md)

## Progress report

The basic Scanner class randomly broke down. Considerable effort was spent
troubleshooting, with little to show for it. Seems to be a local problem, as
the code is very basic. Using hard coded inputs for the time being, looking
into the Scanner problem later.
	Working with bytes in java is not very convenient. Several utility
classes will need to be coded for output.
	Still no progress on unit testing. Javadocs are mostly up to date. LZW
is going to be pushed back.

## Next week

- Start implementing utility classes for Huffman coding
- Try to get testing started
