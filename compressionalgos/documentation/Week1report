##Progress report

This week's focus has been on reading through the course material, setting up
the project and repos, creating documentation and so on. Very few technical
difficulties thus far. Getting automated unit tests to work properly has 
caused headaches in past software development courses, hopefully there will be
some leeway if a particular test framework is giving trouble.

I had another course overlapping the first lecture so, initially, I was
frankly a little lost on where to start. The course material and project
examples turned out to be very helpful in this regard. Particularly the
thoroughly itemized weekly schedule.

I chose to work on compression algorithms. The subject seems interesting.
Might look up more specialized ones besides Huffman and LZW if the project 
needs more scope.

##Next week
Continuing to follow along the suggested schedule: sketching the core program
using premade data structures, working out tests, Javadoc and so on.
