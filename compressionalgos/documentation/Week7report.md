# Week 7-8

[Time report](https://github.com/aleksinuora/compressionalgos/blob/master/compressionalgos/documentation/Time%20report.md)

## Progress report

Huffman algorithm is now confirmed to work on text and image files. Fixed a problem with
bad case scenarios that produce very deep Huffman trees, that seemed to do it. Very good
compression with text files, negligible results for image files. This is to be expected,
as most image formats are already highly compressed.

Implemented some more data structures and utilities. Huffman should be all but done now,
waiting for main class testing and performance tests.

LZW seems doable. First go already halfway done, hopefully it will be ready, bug free,
tested and documented by final deadline.

## Rest of the week

LZW marathon.
