###Study program

Computer Science, Bachelor studies

#Project specification
This project concerns the implementation and performance comparison of two or more compression algorithms, including at least Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv compression.
All documentation, reports etc. will be in English. Programming will be done in Java.

##Initial estimate of necessary data structures
* Huffman tree
* Min Heap
* Hash table
* Binary tree
* Various minor utility functions

##I/O
###Compression
* Input: any type of file
* Output: a compressed file

###Decoding
* Input: a previously compressed file
* Output: the original, uncompressed file

###UI
* prompt for file source and destination paths

##Space/time complexity
Various sources cite between O(nlogn) and O(n) time complexity for both Huffman and Lempel-Ziv compression algorithms, depending on several factors. This seems to be
a reasonable benchmark.

Space complexities should be in the range of O(n).
