#Week 5

[Time report](https://github.com/aleksinuora/compressionalgos/blob/master/compressionalgos/documentation/Time%20report.md)

##Progress report

A lot of progress on utility classes, decompression and even some unit
testing. Compression seems to put out something sensible, decompression
output is mostly garbage. Unit testing will most likely sort out the bugs.
Javadocs are up to date.

##Next week

Unit testing, bug fixing. HashMap and PriorityQueue implementation.
